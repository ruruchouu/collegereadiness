<!-- Overview of Tips -->

  
<h2> Study Habits </h2>
<p> Studying is absolutely essential skill to have in high school but not all students do it correctly. It is very important to take a look at what is being done right and what is being done wrong. </p>

<h2> Tips to Improve </h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Calendar is a necessity. </strong> Staying organized depends highly on keeping it updated properly and following all homework and projects set for the day and throughout the weeks.</li>
  <li>Ensure that a <em>quiet</em> study space is made at home or even go to the library to find the right environment. </li>
  <li>Keep social media and distractions such as phones and other objects far from reach. When taking breaks, go out for a breath of fresh air or exercise in place, but make sure to keep a time limit to remind you to return. </li> 
  <li>Do not be afraid to ask for help. After school tutoring in the library is a resource as well as your teachers themselves. </li>
<li>Look up reliable additional resources from the internet. </li>
</ul>

<!-- Different Styles of Learning -->

  

<p>I highly recommend the above websites. Remember to not only use one style of learning or studying. Try other styles to see which aspect is easiest for the subject.</p>
<p>A test for understanding could be to see if you could possibly simplify the subject or theme to terms simple enough for a young child to understand. Either verbally or textually, try to express those thoughts based on recall alone. Rank yourself from 1- 10, 10 being excellent and easy to understand to 1 being barely comprehensible or lacking in sufficient information. </p>

<ul>
<li>Try listening to <strong> an audiobook or recording of your own voice</strong> for English or History. Test if it helps you.</li>
<li>Make <strong> study guides</study>for each unit or framework objective. I recommend the <a href="QECBlank.html">QEC Method </a>. This method utilizes Question, Evidence, and Conclusion to help smoothen the study process.</li>
<li>Use the method of loci. You visalize an image and attach it to each concept you hope to memorize.Then visualize the images in order to form a cohesive map and repeat the visualization process for recall and memorization. Best done with simple concepts and ideas.</li>
</ul>
