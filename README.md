# College Readiness for High Schoolers

## Website Coding in High School

This project was completed as an SL Computer Science Internal Assessment (IA) for the IB Diploma Programme at Great Oak High School (GOHS). 
I learned HTML and CSS to create this website outside of Java that was being taught in class. 

- Purpose: The target audience for the website was other high schoolers that were new to the variety of programs available at our high school. It was meant to be a website hub primarily focusing on the educational planning for first generation students with additional sections for driver's license, college application information, and mental health awareness. 

- Task: Code a website targeting high school students ranging from freshmen level to senior level, with information primarily drawn from Great Oak High School. 

- Process: I would interview a user/client that wanted this website to be created. We limited the scope and main mission for the website. I would go on to code the website within the upcoming 2-3 months and iterate upon the prototype with client feedback. I would finalize the project through hosting on a website domain. 

- Result: I coded a working HTML website; however, when hosted, I realized the CSS parameters were scaled incorrectly for the website so the formatting was off. In hindsight, I should have tested and previewed my work on multiple platforms before finalizing for turn-in.
