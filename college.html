<!-- College App Overview -->

  

<h2> College Apps and Prerequisites</h2>
<p>College applications are always a stressful time of the year especially for seniors and even more so with IB seniors due to the amount of regular tasks assigned during that month. So..my main tip is to accomplish the prerequisites during the summer prior to senior year in order to facillitate smooth sailing :) </p>

<h2>Types of College Applications</h2>
<p> The main few college applications you will deal with generally require only online application and information; however, a select few may contact you for faxing additional financial information and other information. 
<ol>
 <li>UC Application <a href="https://admissions.universityofcalifornia.edu/applicant/login.htm">Register</a></li>
 <li>Common App <a href="https://apply.commonapp.org/Login?sto=1">Register</a></li>
 <li>The Coalition<a href="http://www.coalitionforcollegeaccess.org/">Register</a></li>
 <li>CSU Mentor<a href="http://www.csumentor.edu/AdmissionApp/">Register</a></li>
</ol>
Most are covered by these 4. Of course, certain private schools have different procedures. This is why research is definitely high on the list.

<!-- Important Information -->

  

<h2> Essential Tips for Incoming Freshmen</h2>
<ul>
<li> Maintain an extracurricular activity for <strong> both depth and breadth.</strong> In simple terms, do it for an extended period of time to show dedication as well as facilitate either leadership or a new activity within that field.</li>
<li> Same with community service. Stay dedicated to each task for an extended period of time. An example would be Garden Club... maintaining a consistent membership is significant in the eyes of admission counselors </li>
<li> Do NOT assume all colleges only view junior and senior year grades. Some view sophomore year grades and even freshman year grades. Stay on top of it! </li>
<li> MAKE SURE SAT and ACT Scores are good </li> 
</ul>

<!-- Summer Prerequisites -->

  

<h2> Prerequisites to Accomplish over the Summer before Senior Year</h2>
<ul>
<li> Collect all community service related activities on a list</li>
<li> Collect all awards and leadership related activities on a list</li>
<li> <strong> A Must Do is to fill out the letter of recommendation packet EARLY for each teacher needed for the college application. </strong> My personal recommendation is to choose one teacher that has seen you facilitate a form of leadership and choose the other in one of the major humanities <em>related to the career/major field</em> you want to go into </li> 
<li> If the prompts for college app essays are out, get going at filling them out!! Do not wait. Revision is always a necessity! </li>
<li> Look up the majors or careers you are interested in if you are still uncertain. Undeclared is a possibility. </li>
<li> Do not feel disgruntled by other's applications or views. Stay on track. </li> 
<li> DEFINITELY. Apply to some scholarships early. The earlier the better. Fill out the local chapter's Dollars for Scholars application. </li>
<li> SUBMIT the application prior to the deadline. Make sure to  check your main email once the apps are all submitted. Good luck!
</ul>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<h3>What types of testing is definitely needed under the UC system?</h3>
<p>Either the SAT or ACT or both systems of testing should be utilized in order to gain admission to colleges across America. Make sure to check the dates for when you are free.</p>
<ol>
  <li>SAT with Writing <a href="https://www.collegeboard.org/">Register for SAT</a></li>
  <li>ACT with Writing <a href="http://www.act.org/content/act/en/products-and-services/the-act/registration.html">Register for ACT</a></li>
</ol>

<h4>The difference between SAT and ACT</h4>
<p>Both ACT and SAT scores are used for college admissions and merit-based scholarships. The biggest differences between the tests are that the ACT has a Science Test, and there's one SAT Math Section for which you cannot use a calculator.</p>
<p>I personally recommend taking the PSAT for practice in sophomore year and a practice ACT under proper testing conditions to evaluate which one you are most aligned to doing well in.</p>
<p>Some students take both. The max number of times it would be <em>recommended</em> to retake would be around 3 times to max out the scores. Taking the tests more seems rather redundant. </p>


<h3>What type of testing is highly recommended or required for certain majors/universities?</h3>

<p>The <strong> SAT subject tests</strong> are highly recommended depending on the major for UCs. For schools outside of the UCs such as Ivy Leagues or other privates, sometimes these are required tests for admission. You should check the websites regarding your dream colleges as soon as possible.
<a href="http://www.compassprep.com/subject-test-requirements-and-recommendations/">Colleges and SAT Subject Tests:Required or Considered</a> 
</p>

<p><strong>BEST USED TO SHOWCASE INTERESTS, PASSIONS, AND STRENGTHS</strong>
For UCSD, bio or physical science applicants often should take Math Level 2 and a science subject test related to applicant's intended major.For UCSB, Math Level 2 is recommended for College of Engineering applicants. Please check the websites.
