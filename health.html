<!-- Overview -->

  
<h2>Health </h2>
<p> Maintaining a healthy mindset and lifestyle is essential. A few tools around school include Peer Leaders, Peer Mediation, counselors, and the advice of teachers. Especially the stress of AP and IB exams often reduce the amount of sleep and food that a student is able to obtain. There may also be a shortage of social involvement due to the heavy workload so learning to facillitate a balance is essential.</p>

<h2> Health Tips</h2>
<ul> 
<li>Keep a calendar. Make sure all the priority projects and hw are accomplished and if teachers allow for advance notice, do those assignments early as well, it definitely saves time and stress later when tests all pile on the same day. </li>
<li> Stay hydrated. Burn out happens easily without hydrating </li>
<li> Obtain a healthy amount of sleep. Do not allow homework to fully occupy all aspects of one's life </li>
<li> Try to create a consistent exercise schedule!!</li>
<li> Stay aligned to positive media and influences. Avoid drugs and drinking. Gambling is also a big no no. </li>
<li> If cheating becomes a tempting alternative to all the stress, it is better to move to a lower class or sacrifice one small grade than to allow that to ruin your opportunities to go to college </li>
</ul>
